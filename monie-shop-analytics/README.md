# Moniepoint Analytics

This is a project for the Moniepoint Hackathon (Feb 2025). It includes a backend built with Flask and a frontend built with React and TypeScript.

## Features
- Analyzes sales data from Monieshop.
- Displays metrics like highest sales volume, most sold product, etc.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**:
  - Vite (for fast builds and development)
  - TypeScript (for type safety)
  - React (for building the UI)
  - shadcn-ui (for pre-built, customizable components)
  - Tailwind CSS (for utility-first styling)
- **Backend**:
  - Flask (Python web framework)

## Why I Chose These Tools
- **Vite**: Provides a faster and more efficient development experience compared to traditional tools like Webpack.
- **TypeScript**: Adds type safety, reducing bugs and improving code quality.
- **React**: Enables a component-based architecture, making the UI more modular and maintainable.
- **shadcn-ui**: Offers pre-built, customizable components, speeding up UI development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Simplifies styling with utility-first CSS, making it easier to build responsive designs.
